## Abstract
With the development of wireless technology, SMS spam has become a serious problem and
resulting in various negative consequences. To address this issue, the detection and interception of spam messages are imperative, necessitating the development of advanced spam detection algorithms. This study aims to classify SMS spam based on natural language processing and determine the optimal combination among eight possible combinations of feature extraction techniques and machine learning algorithms for accurate and reliable spam detection. Previous studies have explored several machine learning algorithms for spam classification and identified some with high accuracy. After review, this study selected Bag of Words, TF-IDF and Bert Embedding as feature extraction techniques and applied four machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree. In this study, accuracy, F-1 score and confusion matrix are used as evaluation metrics to identify the combination of feature extraction method and machine learning algorithm with the highest performance. The experimental results show that the best combination is BoW and Naive Bayes, which achieves 99.2% accuracy. Unlike traditional learning, this study sets up a control group and controls variables, filling the accuracy gap of the algorithm under different feature extraction methods and consolidating the foundation for future spam detection research.
